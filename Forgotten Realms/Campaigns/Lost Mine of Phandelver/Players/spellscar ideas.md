Here are some balanced **Spellscarred Abilities** for your **Male High Elf Wizard** who survived the **Spellplague** in a **Dungeons & Dragons 5e** campaign. These abilities are designed to be flavorful but not overpowering, making them suitable for most campaigns.

**Spellscar Abilities (Choose One or Work with Your DM for Customization)**

  

**1. Arcane Flux (Rebound Magic)**

â€¢ **Once per Long Rest**, when you fail a saving throw against a spell, roll a **d6**. On a **5 or 6**, you instead succeed.

â€¢ On a **1**, a random magical effect occurs (DMâ€™s discretion or use the Wild Magic Surge table).

  

ðŸ“œ _Your spellscar occasionally twists the Weave to protect you, but sometimes at a price._

**2. Plague-Touched Mysticism**

â€¢ You learn **one Metamagic option** from the **Sorcererâ€™s Metamagic list** and gain **1 Sorcery Point** per Long Rest, usable only for that Metamagic.

â€¢ Your spellscar gives your magic an eerie, uncontrollable flexibility.

  

ðŸ“œ _The chaotic remnants of the Spellplague linger in your spells, allowing minor but impactful alterations._

**3. Wound of the Weave**

â€¢ When casting a **spell of 1st level or higher**, you can choose to take **1d4 Force damage** to increase the spellâ€™s **range, duration, or area of effect** by **50%** (rounded up).

â€¢ If you take this damage more than once in a turn, you suffer **disadvantage on Constitution saving throws** to maintain concentration.

  

ðŸ“œ _The scarred remains of Mystraâ€™s Weave still course through you, amplifying your magic but at a painful cost._

**4. Reality Tear**

â€¢ As a **Reaction**, once per Long Rest, when you take damage from a spell or magical effect, you can teleport **up to 15 feet** and gain temporary hit points equal to your Wizard level.

â€¢ At 10th level, this increases to **30 feet**.

  

ðŸ“œ _Your exposure to the Spellplague has left your presence slightly unstable, letting you blink between spaces instinctively._

**5. Weave-Burn**

â€¢ When you roll **damage** for a spell, you can reroll **one die**, but you must use the new result.

â€¢ Once per Long Rest, you can cast **Detect Magic** or **Identify** without expending a spell slot.

  

ðŸ“œ _The Spellplague left an echo in your mind that lets you manipulate raw magic more easily._

**6. Chaotic Spellbrand**

â€¢ Once per Long Rest, when you cast a **Wizard spell**, you can choose to roll on the **Wild Magic Surge Table (PHB p. 104)**. If the result is beneficial, it lasts twice as long or is twice as potent.

â€¢ If the effect is harmful, you can choose to **reduce its duration by half**.

  

ðŸ“œ _Your spellscar flares with raw, untamed magic, sometimes producing strange and unpredictable results._
