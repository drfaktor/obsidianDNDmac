## Overview
**Toril** was the third planet from the [[sun]] in [[Realmspace]]. It was orbited by one moon named [[Selûne]], and by a cluster of asteroids, known as the [[Tears of Selûne]].

Throughout most of its history, Toril was known less commonly as **Abeir-Toril**. The name "Abeir-Toril" was archaic, meaning "cradle of life" in an extinct and forgotten language. Since the [[Spellplague]] and the revelation of the existence of a planetary sibling known as [[Abeir]], and the fact that both Abeir and Toril were once united, the latter name came to informally mean the formerly united worlds of Abeir and Toril.

## Geography
Toril was comparable in size to the planet [[Earth]] with an equatorial circumference of about 40,000 kilometers. Its polar circumference was slightly smaller, at approximately 40,100 kilometers.

Toril consisted of various continents and islands, including [[Faerûn]], [[Kara-Tur]] and [[Zakhara]] in the central super-continent and, throughout most of its history [[Anchorome]], [[Maztica]],  and [[Katashaka]] in the western region of the world. There was also one large and very mysterious continent east of Kara-Tur called [[Osse]] whose nature and inhabitants were all but unknown.

Following the Spellplague, however, Maztica was sent to Abeir, the sibling world of Toril, and a new continent, [[Laerakond]], appeared in the west. Maztica returned to Toril during the [[Second Sundering]]

- **[[Faerûn]]**: The westernmost portion of Toril's central supercontinent, a diverse landscape inhabited by numerous races and cultures, including [[Humans]], [[Dwarves|dwarves]], [[elves]], [[Halflings]], and [[gnomes]].
- **[[Zakhara]]**: A mostly hot, arid realm dominated by elemental forces and a philosophy of [[Fate]] and Honor.
- **[[Kara-Tur]]**: The east, steeped in ancient history.
- **[[Maztica]]**: Primitive cultures bound by duty to their gods gave blood sacrifices in return for power while those who disagreed with the practice struggled to survive.
- **[[Anchorome]]**: Hardly explored, seemingly populated with violent elves and more of the humans found in Maztica.
- **[[Katashaka]]**: South of Maztica. Unexplored.
- **[[Laerakond]]**: A continent formerly located in the world of Abeir, a land of [[dragon]] empires and "new" cultures.
- **[[Osse]]**: Populated by spiritualists and [[druids]], the spirit world and nature dominated the lives of its inhabitants. Unexplored.

## History
The known history of Toril spans for thousands of years, extending back into the misty epochs after [Ao](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ao "Ao") sundered the world of Abeir-Toril after the [Tearfall](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tearfall "Tearfall"), splitting it into the two twin planets, Abeir and Toril.

### The Dawn Ages

The **Dawn Age** was a period lasting from [−30,000 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-30000_DR "-30000 DR") to [−24,000 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-24000_DR "-24000 DR"), after the powerful empires of the [Creator races](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Creator_race "Creator race")disappeared from the face of Toril and their land was occupied by [dragons](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dragons "Dragons") and [giants](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giants "Giants"). Constant war for land in [Faerûn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn "Faerûn") led to the creation of great kingdoms and empires.

### The First Flowering[](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril?veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: The First Flowering")

_Main article: [First Flowering](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/First_Flowering "First Flowering")_

The **First Flowering** was a period in Faerûn's history between [−24,000 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-24000_DR "-24000 DR") and [−12,000 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-12000_DR "-12000 DR")[[17]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril#cite_note-GHotR-12-17). At the start of this period, the [elves](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elf "Elf") had split into five major realms: [Aryvandaar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Aryvandaar "Aryvandaar"), [Illefarn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Illefarn "Illefarn"), [Keltormir](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Keltormir "Keltormir"), [Miyeritar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Miyeritar "Miyeritar") and [Shantel Othreier](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shantel_Othreier "Shantel Othreier"), as well as several smaller ones such as [Eiellûr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Eiell%C3%BBr "Eiellûr"), [Ilythiir](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ilythiir "Ilythiir"), [Orishaar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orishaar "Orishaar"), [Syòrpiir](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sy%C3%B2rpiir "Syòrpiir") and [Thearnytaar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thearnytaar "Thearnytaar").

It was during this time when the elves cast a [ritual](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ritual "Ritual") known as the [Sundering](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/First_Sundering "First Sundering") to create the [Isle of Evermeet](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Evermeet "Evermeet"), that also resulted in widespread disaster which destroyed or altered much of the world.

### The Founding Time
**The Founding Time** was the period when the [humanoid](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Humanoid "Humanoid") civilizations began to rise, in a time when the many dragons and giants were long overthrown and the [elf wars](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Crown_Wars "Crown Wars") no longer loomed over everyone as a threat.
### The Age of Humanity
The **Age of Humanity** was the period from about [−3000 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-3000_DR "-3000 DR") to [1358 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1358_DR "1358 DR"). This period began with the decline of the elven and [dwarven](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dwarf "Dwarf") empires and the flourishing and expansion of the [human](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Human "Human") empires around the world.

### The Present Age
The **Present Age** was the time period that started in the year [1000 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1000_DR "1000 DR") and continues to the present. It was considered one of the most tumultuous ages in the history of Toril. It was a time of constant struggle but also a time of discovery and exploration.

It included such calamitous events like the [Time of Troubles](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Time_of_Troubles "Time of Troubles") of [1358 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1358_DR "1358 DR"), the [Spellplague](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spellplague "Spellplague") of [1385 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1385_DR "1385 DR"), and the [Second Sundering](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Sundering "Second Sundering") of the decade of the [1480s DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1480_DR "1480 DR").
