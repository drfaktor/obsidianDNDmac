The **Astral Plane**, also known as the **Astral Sea**, was one of the [[Cosmology|planes of existence]] in various models of [[Cosmology|cosmology]].



## Geography
The Astral could be reached from almost any point in a Prime Material plane or first layer of any Outer plane by [spell](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spell "Spell"), [psionic](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Psionic "Psionic")ability, or device. It was described as a barren place of other-dimensional nothingness extending in all directions. What little solid substance that floated in the bright, gray void was typically chunks of matter broken off from their original plane. The Astral had no gravity but objects did retain their mass so you could throw small items or push off from large objects to move in the weightless environment.

Time in the Astral flowed at the same rate on a Prime Material plane but the _effects_ of time were slowed almost to a stop―a thousand years in the Astral plane felt like only a day to the traveler. Hence, it was sometimes considered effectively timeless. Creatures did not go hungry or age while in the Astral plane. For that reason, its mortal inhabitants needed to return to the Material Plane in order to have children or to reach adulthood.

Entering the Astral plane could be accomplished in one of two ways: projecting your astral form into the plane via the _[astral projection](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_projection "Astral projection")_ spell, or by physically entering the plane. _Astral projection_ was the safest way to travel but still involved risk because you left your physical body behind on the traveler's plane of origin. The astral body would be accompanied by the astral forms of any items and clothing that were magical or radiated a magic aura. While projecting, your astral self was connected to your physical body by a silver cord that stretched out behind you for about 10 feet (3 meters), or 1 foot (30 centimeters) depending on the version of the spell, and then became invisible and intangible. Very few things could sever this silver cord: a powerful psychic wind, a [githyanki](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Githyanki "Githyanki") _[silver sword](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Githyanki_silver_sword "Githyanki silver sword")_, or the will of [gods](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gods "Gods"). The physical body left behind appeared alive but did not require food, water, or air and did not age. It could be moved and was vulnerable to damage and death. If the traveler's physical body was slain, death followed the projection some minutes later. If the astral self was slain, the traveler then returned to his or her physical body in a coma. Physically entering the Astral plane required a spell such as _[plane shift](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Plane_shift "Plane shift")_ and brought travelers wholly into the Astral with no silver cord to anchor them to their plane of origin.

_One of many dead gods in the Astral Plane._

Upon entering the Astral plane, travelers saw a silvery _[color pool](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Color_pool "Color pool")_ nearby—a portal to the location on the Prime Material plane from which they originated. _Astral projecting_ travelers saw their silver cord leading back to this pool. Color pools appeared as two-dimensional circles about 10‒60 ft (3‒18 m) in diameter and only visible from one side unless they had some way to detect invisible objects. Pools of different colors were portals to the different [Outer planes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_planes "Outer planes"). Each Outer plane had its own unique color, but the traveler's home portal was always a metallic silver, rippling like mercury in a pan. Color pools could be used to view the destination plane before stepping through by mentally concentrating on the nearby pool until it became transparent. A viewer could also move (with some limitations) the portal's viewpoint by concentration._Astral projecting_ travelers formed a new physical body (with silver cord attached) when they stepped through a color pool to their destination plane. The new body was formed out of local materials so the greater the similarity between one's home plane and the destination, the more one's new body looked like the original one.

It was considered to be boundless.

## Cosmology

### Great Wheel

According to the [[Great Wheel Cosmology]] model, the Astral plane connected the [[Prime Material Plane|Prime Material Planes]] to the first layers of the [[Outer planes]].

_The Position of Realmspace (left) in the Astral plane._

In some versions of the Great Wheel cosmology held in the late 15th century [DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/DR "DR"), it was possible to travel to the Astral plane directly from [wildspace](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wildspace "Wildspace") aboard a [spelljammer](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spelljammer "Spelljammer"). In this cosmology, wildspace was a region where the Prime and the Astral overlapped. Moreover, upon exiting a wildspace system such as [Realmspace](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Realmspace "Realmspace"), a ship would leave this overlapping region and fully enter the Astral. The border between wildspace and the Astral Sea had the appearance of a silvery haze.

Once in the Astral, spelljamming captains could steer their ships in the direction of other wildspace systems or specific locations in the Astral in the same way that individuals would traverse the plane: by concentrating their thoughts on the destination.

This view was in contrast with the prevailing Great Wheel cosmology of the 14th and earlier centuries DR, according to which a ship would encounter a [crystal sphere](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Crystal_sphere "Crystal sphere") at the edge of its system and, if capable of traversing it, would enter the [phlogiston](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Phlogiston "Phlogiston").

_Travelers in the Astral Plane._

In the [[World Tree cosmology]] the Astral plane was described as a shapeless cloud that surrounded _all_ the other planes (including the [Inner Planes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Inner_Planes "Inner Planes") which were not accessible via the Astral in the Great Wheel model). The World Tree cosmology model interpreted the Astral plane as tree-shaped, touching nearly all planes, and overlapping the [World Tree](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/World_Tree "World Tree") as well. The ramification of this was that travel between planes was not easily accomplished without going through the "trunk" of the tree (the Material plane). Direct connections between separate dominions of the gods was only possible by cooperation between the deities in question.

The Astral Plane had the following [traits](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Planar_traits "Planar traits") in the World Tree cosmology model:

- **Subjective Directional Gravity**:[[note 1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_Plane#cite_note-gravnote-1) a traveler picked a "down" direction and "fell" in the direction until a new direction was chosen.
- **Timeless**: the effects of time were suspended until the traveler exited the Astral Plane, whereupon the effects retroactively occurred.
- **Mildly Neutral-Aligned**: no circumstance penalties.
- **Enhanced Magic**: Spells and spell-like abilities required less time to be cast.

Color pools still existed in this model, but an Astral traveler had to choose the destination plane before setting out and would only encounter pools that lead to the chosen plane. To change destinations, the traveler had to reenter the Material plane and then begin the journey anew.

Toril's Material plane actually linked to several other Astral planes, each of which connected Toril to the outer-planer homes of a different set of deities. They were based on the geographical areas of control held by the different pantheons. As such, there was an Astral Plane for the [Maztican](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Maztica "Maztica") and [Zakharan](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zakharan_pantheon "Zakharan pantheon") pantheons (even though many of the Zakharan deities resided on the Material Plane). The [Kara-Turan](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kara-Tur "Kara-Tur") faiths were not connected to their own astral plane, as instead their deities connected to the [Spirit World](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_World "Spirit World"). Very little was known in [Faerûn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn "Faerûn") about these other astral planes, but it was theorized that [Ao](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ao "Ao") supervised them just as he adjudicated the conflicts between the pantheons.

### World Axis

According to the [World Axis cosmology](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/World_Axis_cosmology "World Axis cosmology"), the [Spellplague](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spellplague "Spellplague") set the dominions adrift—they were no longer linked to a tree-shaped Astral plane but floated aimlessly in the Astral Sea.

The Astral Sea was described as being "above" the Prime Material plane and its two reflections, the [Feywild](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Feywild "Feywild") and the [Shadowfell](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowfell "Shadowfell"). The Spellplague destroyed the World Tree and set the [dominions](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dominion "Dominion") of the gods adrift to wander about in the silvery void. Access to the Astral Sea was accomplished through passages found in the world or using the proper ritual. Once in the Sea, travel was initiated by thought and was very similar to flying.

In addition to the astral dominions, the Astral Sea could be used by powerful beings to create [demiplanes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Demiplane "Demiplane") by focusing on an idea and applying a strong will. Each demiplane had its own traits and physical laws as dictated by the one who created it, and was always smaller than an astral dominion. If abandoned, it would break apart and fade from existence just like an astral dominion.

_A showdown on the Astral Sea._

On this plane of thought, the existence of true natives was doubtful.The [githyanki](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Githyanki "Githyanki"), however, had been a dominating presence for long ages, ruled from their great city of [Tu'narath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tu%27narath "Tu'narath") but mostly spread about innumerable fortresses.

Astral searchers, astral streakers, astral whales, the mighty [astral dragons](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_dragon "Astral dragon"), and the tiny kodragons inhabited the Silver Void. The dreaded [astral dreadnoughts](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_dreadnought "Astral dreadnought") were believed by some to be a manifestation of the Astral Plane itself, while others pointed to their indefinitely long tails as an indicator of originating elsewhere.

[Brain collectors](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Brain_collector "Brain collector"), [dhours](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dhour "Dhour"), dreamslayers, [foo creatures](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Foo_creature "Foo creature"), ihagnim, star leviathans, and thendar could also be found here.

All manner of [fiends](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fiend "Fiend"), [celestials](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Celestial "Celestial"), [slaadi](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Slaad "Slaad") and other planars used the Astral as shortcuts to their business elsewhere, but both [astral devas](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_deva "Astral deva") and [shedu](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shedu "Shedu") patrolled the plane regularly to keep evil in check. Despite their connection to the [Abyss](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Abyss "Abyss"), [bebiliths](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bebilith "Bebilith")were thought to be at home on the Astral plane.

Spectral hounds were usually found within githyanki communities as guard animals.

## Deities

The Astral Plane was the graveyard of the gods. If a deity, which could be considered among the greatest of concepts, died, its remnant were cast into this realm of thought. Here it remained as a floating "god-isle", a piece of solid matter within the endless empty void, with only a fraction of residual energy left.

The exceptions to these rules were the gods [Celestian](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Celestian "Celestian") of [Oerth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Oerth "Oerth") and [Anubis](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Anubis "Anubis") of the Pharaonic pantheon. The former, a deity of travelers, kept no permanent [realm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Divine_realm "Divine realm") and wandered the Astral (and sometimes beyond).

[Sardior](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sardior "Sardior")'s [Ruby Palace](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ruby_Palace "Ruby Palace") also rested in the Astral Plane between its travels through the planes.
Known dead deities drifting in the Astral Plane (at least temporarily) were:
